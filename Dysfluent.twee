:: !Welcome to my code! [cut/leftovers] {"position":"3225,50","size":"100,100"}
This project has gone through several iterations (a major factor in the code being so messy throughout the game), and various little things have been cut out along the way.

But I like to keep records of my tests, tools and snippets of writing (even when they're bad or completely obsolete), so I didn't want to just delete all of it! 

I've left most of the unused stuff in here - all passage names starting with "z" - in case anyone else might be interested in them too.

I'd love to hear if anyone finds this page; if you feel like it, you can shoot me a message at allyson_gray@hotmail.com!

Thank you for your interest in my humble game. ☺

A few hours later, you're meeting up with Clementine and finding a nice spot to talk things out. 
It's been a while since you've seen each other one-on-one, and you have a lot to catch up on.

She confides in you about troubles with her partner, and you nod understandingly as she lets out all her worries.

You finish up your preparations and get dressed. 

The only thing left to do before leaving is call the store to ensure your friend's birthday present will be ready for pickup. 

She requested a new and popular card game, and as they're apparently flying off the shelves, you'd better call the store as it opens to make sure there's a copy set aside for you.

Unfortunately, phone calls tend to aggravate your stutter and make your blocks all the more inconvenient (due in part to the lack of nonverbal communication). (colour:$links)[[[Hopefully this one will go smoothly!|Phone Call Start]]]

You start sharing some advice and comforting words, but predictably, you only get so far before your body starts fighting you. 

It takes a lot of struggling and shifting words around, and much more time than you'd like, to finally get all of your thoughts out.

Noticing that you unconsciously averted your gaze during your struggle, you turn back towards your friend and find an appreciative smile on her face as she takes in your words.

"Sorry... I hope that was helpful."

"It was! Honestly, I mostly just wanted to vent, but you actually gave me a lot to think about."

You don't understand the exact cause of your disorder (to your knowledge, science hasn't quite figured it out yet), but it's most likely something in your brain not working as it should. It's been gnawing away at your speech for most of your life, creating gaps and distortions in your sentences.

The silver lining, as you see it, is that your condition isn't as severe as it could have been – you have bouts of fluency, allowing you to pass as a "normal" member of society most of the time. Even on bad days, the telltale signs of an incoming speech block can help you anticipate and avoid it, using the tricks and techniques you've learned over the years... but that doesn't always mean you'll get to say what you want or need to!

Managing your sleep schedule and stress levels can help you have more good days, but sometimes it's just out of your control; judging by the fact that yesterday was full of blocks and you still feel that familiar tightness lingering in your throat, you already have a feeling that today's going to be rough.

Finding an excuse to stay in bed just a little longer, you finish perusing your to-do list.

You have two big events planned for today: your friend's birthday party, and a big job interview. You've split the day up into smaller steps:

- Call the store to reserve your friend's birthday present
- Pick up the present on your way to the restaurant
- Meet your friends for lunch
- Pick up your business attire at the dry cleaners
- Get to your job interview

How do you feel about all these commitments?

As you're all enjoying drinks and dessert (if: $dessert is "none")[(except for you)], Clementine decides to christen her brand new game.

She opens the box and reads the instructions aloud.

"Everyone plays as a team and the goal is to get the most points collectively.
On your turn, draw a card and announce the category.
Flip the sand timer, and read 1 of the 3 clues out loud.
If your team guesses correctly at this stage, you get the maximum amount of points. If you think they need extra help, you can share more clues - but each one deducts from your point reward!
Continue in clockwise order until everyone has had a turn, then add up all the points."

"Ok, that sounds good! Who should start?"

"Uh, let me check...
Oh! The first player is the one who most recently had a birthday."

She laughs.

"Here I go, then!"

She draws a card.

"The category is: video games"

He sets the timer as his eyes scan the card. 

- Try to read the 2nd clue
- Try to read the 3rd clue

You read out the card

"Turns to you. Ok, your turn! You against Lee (or everyone?).

But there's one thing that still bothers you:](if: $schoolwell is 2)[Despite some slight hiccups in your academic performance last year, you know that you're on the right track to succeed. There's just one thing that really worries you:]

Your stutter.

You've been a stutterer for years, so it's not exactly a novel situation, but you realized recently that you barely know anything about your disorder. It's been a constant obstacle, but one you've never dared to tackle head-on. 
As you keep developing your social and professional spheres, good communication is going to become an increasingly important part of your life. You're determined to start paying closer attention to your stuttering patterns so that you can become a better communicator.

Fortunately for you, your stutter is only occasional, meaning you often have moments of fluency.
Unfortunately, that also means your stutter can be very unpredictable. Blocks can occur seemingly randomly -- a word you had no problem saying yesterday, or even just moments ago, might suddenly give you a hard time.

Your gaze falls to your radio alarm clock, which is now playing the Beatles' *Good Morning*. "That's enough contemplation for now," you tell yourself as you turn it off. You have to start getting ready!

You step out of bed and pick out your clothes for the day. What do you decide to wear?

[Good old t-shirt and jeans - a classic look.]<tshirt|

[A button-down shirt and dress pants - classy and versatile.]<bdshirt|

[A tank top, sleeveless vest and capri pants - stylish and cool.]<ttop|

^^*Dysfluent* puts you in the shoes of someone who stutters. The dialogue system is altered to reflect this; as is common in stutterers, you can usually feel whether a certain word or phrase is going to give you trouble.^^
^^A (colour: green)[green] dialogue option is one that you're confident you'll be able to enunciate fluently, without stuttering.^^
^^A (colour: yellow)[yellow] dialogue option is likely to be distorted to some degree by your stutter.^^
^^A (colour: red)[red] dialogue option will be affected by a major block and you'll have a hard time getting the words out.^^
^^The colour of the dialogue options is randomized, not predetermined. This means that options (colour: green)[A], (colour: yellow)[B] and (colour: green)[C] from your first playthrough might become (colour: red)[A], (colour: red)[B] and (colour: yellow)[C] in the second.
